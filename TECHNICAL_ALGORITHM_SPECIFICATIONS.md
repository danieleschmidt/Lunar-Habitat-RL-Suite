## 1. Causal Reinforcement Learning (Causal-RL)

### 1.1 Algorithm Overview

**Objective:** Prevent cascading system failures through causal reasoning and counterfactual intervention strategies.

**Key Innovation:** First application of causal graph learning to space life support systems with explicit failure propagation modeling.

### 1.2 Mathematical Formulation

#### Causal Graph Structure
```
G = (V, E, M)
where:
- V = {o2_level, co2_level, temperature, power, crew_health, ...}
- E = {(v_i, v_j) | v_i causally influences v_j}
- M = {mechanism functions describing causal relationships}
```

#### Hamilton's Equations for Causal Dynamics
```
dV_i/dt = ∂H/∂P_i    (causal influence propagation)
dP_i/dt = -∂H/∂V_i   (causal momentum dynamics)
```

#### Counterfactual Query Framework
```
CF(v_target | do(intervention), context) = 
    ∫ P(v_target | do(intervention), U=u) × P(U=u | context) du
```

### 1.3 Network Architecture

**CausalConstrainedPolicyGradient:**
- Input Dimension: 48 (habitat state space)
- Hidden Layers: 256 → 256 → 256 
- Output Dimension: 26 (continuous control actions)
- Causal Constraint Network: 74 → 256 → 1 (violation score)
- Activation: Swish (self-gating for gradient flow)

**Causal Graph Learner:**
```python
class CausalGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.variables = {'o2_level', 'co2_level', 'pressure', ...}
        self.mechanisms = {thermal, electrical, atmospheric, mechanical}
        self.graph = NetworkX.DiGraph()
    
    def learn_structure(self, data):
        # PC algorithm with physics constraints
        # Structural equation learning
        # Intervention effect estimation
```

### 1.4 Training Algorithm

```
For each episode:
    1. Observe state s_t
    2. Query causal graph for failure risks
    3. Generate base action a_t from policy π(s_t)
    4. Check causal safety constraints
    5. If unsafe: compute intervention targets
    6. Apply constrained action a'_t
    7. Update causal model with experience
    8. Compute policy gradient with causal regularization
```

## 2. Hamiltonian-Constrained RL (Hamiltonian-RL)

### 2.1 Algorithm Overview

**Objective:** Ensure energy conservation and thermodynamic consistency in policy optimization through Hamiltonian mechanics integration.

**Key Innovation:** First application of Hamiltonian Neural Networks to reinforcement learning with symplectic structure preservation.

### 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

#### Hamiltonian Function
```
H(q, p) = T(p) + V(q) + E_physics(q, p)
where:
- q = positions (temperatures, pressures, concentrations)
- p = momenta (thermal flows, mass flows, energy flows)
- T(p) = kinetic energy (quadratic in momenta)
- V(q) = potential energy (depends on positions)
- E_physics = thermodynamic energy contributions
```

#### Hamilton's Equations of Motion
```
dq/dt = ∂H/∂p     (generalized velocities)
dp/dt = -∂H/∂q    (generalized forces)
```

#### Symplectic Integration (Leapfrog Method)
```
p_{n+1/2} = p_n + (dt/2) × (-∂H/∂q)|_n
q_{n+1} = q_n + dt × (∂H/∂p)|_{n+1/2}  
p_{n+1} = p_{n+1/2} + (dt/2) × (-∂H/∂q)|_{n+1}
```

#### Thermodynamic Entropy Regularization
```
S = -k_B Σ p_i ln(p_i)    (statistical entropy)
ΔS ≥ 0                   (second law constraint)
L_entropy = λ × max(0, -ΔS)  (entropy penalty)
```

### 2.3 Network Architecture

**HamiltonianFunction:**
- Position Network: 24 → 256 → 256 → 1 (potential energy)
- Momentum Network: 24 → 256 → 256 → 1 (kinetic energy)

@dataclass
class PhysicsConstants:
    R_universal: float = 8314.46  # J/(kmol·K)
    cp_air: float = 1005          # J/(kg·K)
    stefan_boltzmann: float = 5.67e-8  # W/(m²·K⁴)
    lunar_gravity: float = 1.62   # m/s²
    habitat_volume: float = 1000  # m³
```

### 2.5 Training Algorithm

```
For each policy update:
    1. Sample trajectory τ = {(s_t, a_t, r_t)}
    2. Compute Hamiltonian H(s_t) for each state
    3. Check energy conservation: ΔH < tolerance
    4. Apply symplectic integration for dynamics
    5. Compute policy loss + physics loss
    6. Backpropagate with energy conservation constraints
    7. Update parameters preserving Hamiltonian structure
```

## 3. Meta-Adaptation RL (Meta-RL)

### 3.1 Algorithm Overview

**Objective:** Enable rapid few-shot adaptation to hardware degradation while preventing catastrophic forgetting of safety-critical behaviors.

**Key Innovation:** Physics-aware meta-learning with episodic memory for safety-critical experience replay.

### 3.2 Mathematical Formulation

#### Meta-Learning Objective (MAML-based)
```
min_θ Σ_τ∈D L_τ(f_θ - α∇_θL_τ(f_θ))
where:
- θ = meta-parameters
- α = adaptation learning rate
- τ = task (degradation scenario)
- f_θ = policy network
```

#### Physics-Aware Adaptation
```
θ_adapted = θ - α∇_θ(L_task + λ_physics × L_physics + λ_safety × L_safety)
where:
- L_physics = physics constraint violation penalty
- L_safety = safety-critical experience replay loss
```

#### Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) for Forgetting Prevention
```
L_EWC = Σ_i F_i × (θ_i - θ*_i)²
where:
- F_i = Fisher Information Matrix diagonal element
- θ*_i = optimal parameters for previous tasks
```

### 3.3 Architecture Components

**PhysicsAwareMetaLearner:**

- Physics Constraint Net: 74 → 256 → 1
- Degradation Encoder: 48 → 64 (degradation embedding)
- Adaptation Network: 112 → 256 → 26 (adaptation adjustment)

**EpisodicMemory:**
- Memory Size: 10,000 experiences
- Indexing: By degradation type and severity
- Retrieval: Similarity-based (k-nearest experiences)
- Safety Buffer: Dedicated storage for critical experiences

**HardwareDegradationSimulator:**
```python
class DegradationScenario:
    component: str              # 'pump', 'heater', 'sensor'
    degradation_type: str       # 'efficiency_loss', 'drift', 'intermittent'
    severity: float            # 0.0 to 1.0
    onset_time: float         # Mission time
    progression_rate: float   # How fast it degrades
```

### 3.4 Continual Learning Algorithm

```
For each new degradation scenario:
    1. Detect degradation onset
    2. Retrieve similar experiences from episodic memory  
    3. Compute Fisher Information for current task
    4. Few-shot adaptation (5 gradient steps)
    5. Evaluate on query set
    6. Update meta-parameters with EWC regularization
    7. Store experiences with degradation context
    8. Validate safety retention on critical scenarios
```

### 3.5 Degradation Models

**Pump Efficiency Loss:**
```python
def simulate_pump_degradation(state, action, severity):
    efficiency_factor = 1.0 - severity * 0.8
    action[pump_indices] *= efficiency_factor
    state[flow_indices] *= efficiency_factor
    return state, action
```

**Sensor Drift:**
```python
def simulate_sensor_drift(state, severity):
    drift_magnitude = severity * 0.1
    for temp_idx in temperature_sensors:
        drift = np.random.normal(0, drift_magnitude)
        state[temp_idx] += drift
    return state
```

- **Continual Learning Success Rate:** 87% across scenarios
